<h1> Entry 2: Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez</h1>
<h3>(Butterflies and too many names)</h3>



<p>
   <h2>Description</h2>
   This author sort of altered my brain chemistry and how I think about literature, the world, and culture - how can we discern what is <em>real</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp and what is magic? 
   <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp How do we interpret our own biases on the world?
   <br>
   Not exactly a "casual" read sort of author, but something everyone should look into, just to see the powers of magical realism
